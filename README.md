# SShuttle-GUI
GUI for [SShuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) - Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN. Forwards over ssh.

**Dependencies:** sshuttle sshpass gtk2 polkit fping systemd iptables

Perhaps the easiest-to-use tool for encrypting the connection and the corresponding bonuses. The closest analogue of `WARP` or something similar. Just rent your `VPS`, enter the received `Login`, `Password`, VPS IP and `Port` (22 by default) for SSH access and click the `Start` button.  
  
**Note:** Of course, you should not use your isp's DNS. Install them, for example from Google: `8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`, if they are not blocked in your country yet.  
  
The Internet will be free!
